# Navigating Files/Directories

The Unix file system is organized in a hierarchical structure, starting from the root directory ("/") and branching out into various directories and subdirectories. Here are some essential commands for navigating the file system:
pwd: Print the current working directory.
ls: List files and directories in the current directory.
-l: Long format, providing detailed information about files.
-a: Include hidden files and directories.
cd: Change directory.
cd [directory]: Move to the specified directory.
cd ..: Move up one directory level.
cd ~: Move to the home directory.
